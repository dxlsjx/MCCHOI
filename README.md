# Efficient Mamba-based Comprehensive Context Learning for Zero-Shot HOI Detection
Official implementation of the paper: "Efficient Mamba-based Comprehensive Context Learning for Zero-Shot HOI Detection"
## Dataset
We recommend placing all datasets in the same directory (say `$DATA`) looks like
```
$DATA/
|–– dtd/
|–– oxford_pets/
|–– eurosat/
```

We consider 2 datasets for evaluation the effectiveness of the proposed method:
* [HICO-DET](https://umich-ywchao-hico.github.io/)
* [V-COCO](https://github.com/s-gupta/v-coco)


## Contact
If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue in this repository.

## Note
We will release the code on GitHub upon acceptance of the paper.
